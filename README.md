Welcome to Bear Tracks Sniper. 

Nowadays, courses at universities tend to fill up before a student has the opportunity to enroll. With the automatic enrollment bot, students will have a tool to automate their enrollment process.

A student just has to add their desired courses in their schedule builder and the bot will take care of everything else. When a course is full, the bot will continually monitor the status of that course until it becomes open. When the course is open, it will automatically enroll the student in the course.

Disclaimer
The bot requires a user to provide their student information in a local .env file. Although the file is local, this is still be unsafe. In addition, the bot was made for both education purposes and for my own personal use. Therefore, before using the bot, please understand that you are using it at your own risk. If anything occurs, I take no responsibility.
